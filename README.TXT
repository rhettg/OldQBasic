        Hello everybody. Here is all the old basic stuff I have.
I havn't done much Qbasic stuff for a while so most of this is simple,
old and not finished. 
        I never document stuff but I have gone back and documented it
for the good of all of you. I hope I got it all. I don't know how hard
it is to dig through all the code being that I wrote it and probably
remember stuff so it isn't the same as someone viewing it for the first
time.  Good luck, I'm not real proud of it but it should be good
for a few laughs. (I hope its not that bad)
